AUthentication
__________________

1) Open web.config in the root directory.

2)Inside <System.Web> tag in web.config add the following 

      <authentication mode="Forms">
      <forms loginUrl="~/Views/Authentication/Login.aspx" defaultUrl="ViewEmployees.aspx">        
      </forms>      
    </authentication>

    <authorization>
      <deny users="?"/>
    </authorization>



loginUrl - specifies the path of your login page. If the user is not authenticated 
it will redirect to login page.

<deny users="?"/> - Means that don't allow anonymous users to access to your webforms.


The issue with this approach is that even login.aspx and register.aspx pages will not be shown to end user.

3.Inorder to show register and login pages you need to add a new web.config file in the folder where these pages are.


4.Inside <System.Web> tag in the newly added web.config add the following 
     <authorization>
      <allow users="*"/>
    </authorization>



The above tags means that anonymous users can access the login and register page.
